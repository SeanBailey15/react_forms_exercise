# React Forms Exercise

## Description

In this exercise, students get hands-on practice writing forms with React. The goal is to create two separate apps, each focused on updating, validating, and gathering info from a single form.

### Part 1: Color Box Maker

This app consists of a form that accepts a width*, height*, and color**. Once submitted, the app will render a box of the given dimensions and color onto the page. Each box is accompanied by a button that allows the user to remove the box from the page.  

**The dimensions are counted in pixels.*

***The color must be one of the NAMED CSS standard colors.*

### Part 2: Todo App

This app is just as the name implies, a To-do list app. There is a single input on the page where a user can enter a task they want to add to the list. Each task will be rendered to the page, along with a button to remove the task once completed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SeanBailey15/react_forms_exercise.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory:

    ```bash
    cd react_forms_exercise
    ```

** Note: Each app is independent of the other. You should navigate into, and install requirements seperately for each. **

3. Navigate into color_box_maker:

    ```bash
    cd color_box_maker
    ```

4. Install the requirements:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. Navigate back to the main directory:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

6. Navigate into todo_app:

    ```bash
    cd todo_app
    ```

7. Install the requirements:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the apps

Now that you have both apps installed, you can navigate into either app directory and run the app with ```npm run dev```.

You can also run the tests for each app with ```npm run test``` while within an app directory.
